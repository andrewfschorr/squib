# Squib

ES6 Basic templateing for fun and definitely-not-profit

### Installation

If using npm/yarn

```
$ npm install squib --save
```
Or
```
$ yarn add squib
```

But since this the motivation for this came from just an in-browser vanilla JS MVC, MVP it's it also needs to be available as a script include, thanks to the heroes at https://unpkg.com/ it can be included via a script tag like so:

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/squib@0.1.1/dist/squib.js"></script>
```

Or copy üçù from dist/squib.js if you really want to for whatever reason.
